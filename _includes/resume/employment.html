  <h3>Contract Software Developer</h3>
  <h4>Fabulous Software, Inc. • Nov 2018 - Present</h4>
  <p>
    Started my own company, <a href="https://fabsoft.io">Fabulous Software, Inc.</a> and worked as a
    contract software developer. During this time I secured a contract to work on AFPIMS,
    the content management system that over 1500 websites use in the Department of
    Defense. Sites I work on include war.gov (previously defense.gov), marines.mil,
    af.mil, usace.army.mil, navy.mil, pavilion.dinfos.edu, and more. I was able to use my
    full range of skills and developed both backend and frontend solutions using DNN, C#,
    JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Vue.js, and Webpack.
  </p>
  <p>
    During this time I kept up my relationship with Sycorr and continued supporting the
    Bank of North Dakota's loan management system, and MHADOT's licensing system, and
    other projects as needed.

  <h3>Senior Software Developer</h3>

  <p>
    At Sycorr I led front-end web development strategies as a full stack web developer on
    ASP.NET enterprise systems for banks and other financial institutions. I also served
    as principal web designer and user experience expert. We utilized various technologies
    including .NET MVC5 Framework, C#, JavaScript, MS SQL, HTML5/CSS3, AngularJS, GIT,
    PHP, WordPress, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    My main responsibility was to coordinate our front-end stack with our backend
    development. This resulted in a custom framework that included an AngularJS layout and
    menu system, a JavaScript/jQuery API that worked well with C# and the .NET framework
    to handle AJAX requests and data table layouts, and other custom JavaScript modules.
    My front-end work allowed the company to rapidly develop enterprise applications using
    the framework tools I created.
  </p>

    Projects I worked on included identity auditing software, a custom CRM software
    solution for an insurance agency, loan management software, a back-end system for a
    Native American nation's Dept. of Transportation and Dept. of Equal Opportunity,
    creating a system of object-oriented theme and plugin classes for WordPress, authoring
    many WordPress plugins and themes, developing a proprietary system to auto-update
    WordPress themes and plugins using Amazon Web Services, and working with programmers
    to create front-ends for websites using Razor templates, AngularJS, and a custom
    front-end framework.

    "test, staging, live" development workflow using Git and virtual machines, set up a
    system to monitor our Git repositories and track issues, and have acted as server
    admin on dedicated servers.
  </p>

  <p>
    While at Idea Bank I had the opportunity to build the Hornady.com, Fontanelle. com,
    and ExcelRVs.com websites, all of which have custom PHP programming, 3rd party
    integration, multiple forms, and MODx CMS backends. I also set up over 40 other
